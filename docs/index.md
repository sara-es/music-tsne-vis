
This is a small report for my MATH48061 Multivariate Statistics course. For now I've only uploaded a couple plots.

[Full report](Assessment2-Summerton.pdf)

[Main plot](plot_cluster_f.html)

[Fewer songs](plot_cluster_small3.html)

[All songs](plot_cluster_all.html) (CAREFUL: 4178 data points!) 


This project was heavily inspired by [Alex Clarke's Music and Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/informationcake/music/machine-learning) ongoing project, whose code was helpful.
